# Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data
## Course Project
### README

#### Description
The purpose of the course project is to download real-word data, create an analysis pipeline, derive a tydi dataset and relative documentation.

Assignment consists of:
    1. [Downloading dataset] (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) and unzipping;
    2. Plan on analysis pipeline and download or load necessary libraries;
    3. Writing and R script named R script run_analysis.R which:
        * merge training and the test sets provided into a single dataset;
        * extracts measurements related to mean and std;
        * renames the activities in the dataset with descriptive activity names;
        * renames the above mentioned descriptive headers with clearer labels;
        * generates a tidy dataset (tidy_dataset.txt) which includes the mean of each measurement grouped by activity and subject;
   4. A more in death description of the data collection can be found [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 
);
   5. A description of the data structure and data processing can be found in the CodeBook.md
